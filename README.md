# whiteboard

hosted link: 

This is a basic whiteboard application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a canvas and provides functionalities to reset the canvas and undo the last stroke.

- Click and drag the mouse on the canvas to draw lines.
- Click the "Reset" button to clear the entire canvas.
- Click the "Undo" button to remove the last drawn stroke.

- The canvas element is used to provide the drawing area.
- Mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseout) are used to track user interactions.
- The "Reset" button clears the canvas by calling the `clearRect` method on the canvas context.
- The "Undo" button removes the last drawn stroke by maintaining a history of canvas states.
